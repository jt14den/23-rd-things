## Getting started: What is research data?

**What "research data" are we talking about?**

* Read [Research Data - Definitions] (https://www2.le.ac.uk/services/research-data/documents/UoL_ReserchDataDefinitions_20120904.pdf) from University of Leicester (5 min)
* Watch this video on research data produced by University of California Librarians (5min):

  [![University of California Libraries: Research Data Matters](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Lr722k7NyGU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr722k7NyGU "University of California Libraries: Research Data Matters"){:target="_blank"} (YouTube)

### Research data can be

* **Observational**: Captured in real-time, typically outside the lab
  * Examples: Sensor readings, survey results, images, audio, video
* **Experimental**: Typically generated in the lab or under controlled conditions
  * Examples: test results, clinical trials, field experiments in international development
* **Simulation**: Machine generated from test models
  * Examples: climate models, economic models
* **Derived /Compiled**: Generated from existing datasets
  * Examples: text as data (data mining), compiled database, 3D models

### Research data come in many formats

* **Text**: field or laboratory notes, survey responses
* **Numeric**: tables, counts, measurements
* **Audiovisual**: images, sound recordings, video
* Models, computer code, geospatial data
* **Discipline-specific**: FITS in astronomy, CIF in chemistry, FASTA files in bioinformatics
* **Instrument-specific**: equipment outputs

>## Let’s take a look research data
>*Note: We'll be using the [UCSD Library Digital Collections](http://library.ucsd.edu/dc) for this exercise.* Feel free to swap out with other institutional or discipline based repositories and collections.
>
> 1. Open up one of these collections:
>  * [Data from: A Living Vector Field Reveals Constraints on Galactose Network Induction in Yeast](http://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb5668210c) - The research data collected are microscopy images of field cells, a database file, and analysis code used to investigate how cell-level gene expression dynamics produce population-level phenotypes.
>  * [Santa Fe Light Cone Simulation research project files](http://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb1673671n)- The project consists of data in three broad categories: the simulation data ("Data at Redshift" components); analysis tools and example scripts (Data Processing Tools) for processing the data; and project administration and background documents (Historical Documents) related to the project.
>2. Write down the specific data formats, software used, and wether the collection has a code book or data dictionary. If you aren't familiar with the data formats or software codes, try a web search and see if you can figure out what it is. Capture your findings.
>4. Explore the metadata representing the collection. Besides the title and description, what other elements are described?
> 5. Share with the class what you've found.

>## Heavy Metals
>One interesting and unique data collection in the UCSD Digital Collections is the [Heavy Metals in the Ocean Insect, Halobates](http://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb8056206n) collection.  This is an unique example of ~40 year old computer printed data that was digitized for sharing and preservation.

>How does complexity and range of data formats affect access and re-use possibilities?

>## Learn More: Data across research disciplines
>1. Choose one of the 4 specialized data repositories below, or find another data repository of interest - particularly one in a discipline you are unfamiliar with and spend some time browsing around your chosen repository to get a feel for the data available.
>  * [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
>  * [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
>  * [cancer Nanotechnology Laboratory (caNanoLab)](https://cananolab.nci.nih.gov/caNanoLab/#/)
>  * [USGS Water Data](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)
>  * [World Ocean Database](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD/pr_wod.html)
>
>2. Think about how the data here differs from data you are familiar with.  Consider for example, format, size and access method.
>3. Record your reflections in the class etherpad or through discussion.

>## Discipline based data conventions
>How could cross disciplinary research be affected by discipline data conventions? Also,  think about one way cross disciplinary data access can be facilitated.
{: .discussion}

## Challenge me: Let’s talk tech!

Get the ball rolling to expand awareness of the technical aspects of data management and this rapidly growing community of tech-aware data enthusiasts.
What is....

* your favorite research data tech or software story or experience
* a software tool or service for research data you think others might be interested in
* a question or research data problem to crowdsource a solution.

>## Personal technical data audit
> Conduct a personal audit on what data technical skills you have, and what skills you want to learn.
